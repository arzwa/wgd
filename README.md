Python package and command line interface (CLI) for the analysis
of whole genome duplications (WGDs). Tested with Python3.5 & Python3.6
on Linux Ubuntu. If you don't have python or pip installed a simple
`sudo apt-get install python3-pip` will do on Ubuntu, Debian or Linux
Mint.

    $ git clone https://github.com/arzwa/wgd.git
    $ cd wgd
    $ pip install .

For the command line interface, upon installation run
